        <p>Simba, the King of the Jungle in the Lion King. </p>
        <p> Simba is presented as the future king of Pride Rock. He is the son of Mufasa
            and Sarabi. Viewers can see how Simba deals with his father's death, took refuge with
            his new best friends Timon and Pumbaa, and eventually see him challenge Scar, the previous
            king's killer, and eventually become the rightful King of Pride Rock. </p>
